	<p class="ruleTitle">1. General information Data protection at Messe Frankfurt</p>
	<p>Visitors to the Messe Frankfurt Group internet portal can access many of the information offered there without registering. On subsequent pages, however, it is often necessary for you to enter company-related or personal data, so we can make an offer for the services required or send you information about our events. Naturally we are obligated to ensure that the data you have provided is given sufficient protection within our systems in accordance with the applicable laws. We believe you should be able to rely on your data being handled
		in a responsible and confidential way. Our data-protection concept also incorporates contractors who might need your data to carry out an order to your complete satisfaction.
		It is not our aim to use or pass on personal data without permission and for purposes other than those stated at the time the data was collected.<p>
